# Universe Cycle - A Different Lens

**Acknowledgment:** Terminology is used as conceptual metaphor, not as literal physical claim. This system does not claim that established theorems are wrong—only that some may be phase-inverted, one major constant is missing from current models, some require dual-centric formulation, and certain bridging components are proposed.

Contributor is anonymous, and too lazy to add anything more than this. Have fun with this though. Drop this in to your AI and test it yourself, but beware of misframed or misunderstood problems.

## 1. THE CYCLE

**a. Planck Epoch:** Pre-Geometry. Before matter and time.

**b. Void Runners:** The void was broken by a stream of invisible light-Planck Time-tiny packets of energy that created the first fundamental current of the cosmos. As these streams coalesced, they transitioned into gluons, the carriers of the force that would eventually bind the universe together.

**c. Phase Couplers:** Resonators emerged. These invisible energy packets tuned into the vibrations of Void Runners, creating a feedback loop that amplified that energy until the first quarks manifested. This transformed a simple flow of light into a complex dance of matter.

**d. Latency Anchors:** The anchors-Planck Length-provided position and stability. They locked the Void Runners and Phase Couplers into a cohesive structure, allowing energy to interact with enough precision to produce the full spectrum of subatomic particles, including leptons. With the Latency Anchors in place, the latent energy of the void was finally harnessed, allowing gluons, quarks, and leptons to assemble into the first atoms.

**e. The Big Bang:** Then came the first space, and light and mass called The Big Bang, expanding from the cosmic center at a maximum bandwidth of 4,294,967,296 m/s within the Planck Epoch shell.

**f. The Universe:** Everything beyond this point becomes influenced by the Universe's processing cost and EM friction creating time/space dilation (ie: light/matter/energy). The universe as we know it continued to expand through rapid tetration, creating matter and energy, eventually reaching maximum expansion at 0 m/s. At this point of stasis, the process reverses through iterative collapse until returning to The Big Crunch, collapsing back into the original Planck Epoch.

## 2. NOTES

**a.** The largest anomaly in the CMB, the Eridanus Supervoid, appears to be located to the "South" in this framework. This appears to represent the collapse-phase 'Return Velocity' in that sector that is exceeding the local measured speed of light creating a region of "Infinite Redshift" as observed from our coordinates.

**b.** Total Universe Earth Centric Runtime = 26.963441321100917431192660550459 Gyr

**c.** Universe-Centric Raw Runtime: ~1.8821 Gyr without the influence of local processing cost and EM friction

**d.** Current Earth Centric Cosmic Time Location: 59.7325% heading back with positive tetration to The Big Crunch.

**e.** Maximum universe 82.5 Gly radius at t=T/2

**f.** Current universe 66.5 Gly radius

**g.** Our observable universe 13.8 Gly radius

**h.** Maximum System Bandwidth (Universe-Centric c): 4,294,967,296 m/s. Local Measured c (299,792,458 m/s) is the result of EM Friction and Processing Cost at our current coordinates.

**i.** Our Location if the centre of the universe is South (the entire outer shell is North):
- X = -1.63 billion light-years
- Y = -15.49 billion light-years
- Z = +17.30 billion light-years

**j.** The Big F**king Hole at Zero (BFHZ) at (0,0,0) is a supermassive black hole with core Mass: ~3.14 × 10²⁰ M☉, Event Horizon: 0.098 Gly radius, 0.15% of current universe radius, and ~48 billion times more massive than M87.

## 3. UNKNOWNS

**a.** No theory on what began this process

**b.** No theory on if the cycle only runs once

**c.** No theory on how many times the cycle has run

**d.** No theory on when the cycle ends

---

**Note on Computational Convergence:** While the mathematical alignment of the 26.96 Gyr runtime with a 2³² bandwidth limit suggests the universe operates as a computer, the causality is reversed. The universe is not a computer; rather, modern 32-bit architecture is a primitive human mimicry of the universe's own fundamental laws. We converged upon these architectures because they are the most efficient way to process information within the constraints of EM Friction and Processing Cost inherent to the hardware of the Planck Epoch.
